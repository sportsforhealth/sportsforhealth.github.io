	<p>Sport (UK) or sports (US) are all forms of usually competitive physical activity or games which,
	through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and
	 skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, entertainment for spectators.
	Usually the contest or game is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some
	 sports allow a tie game; others provide tie-breaking methods, to ensure one winner and one loser.
	 A number of such two-sided contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion.
	 Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season,
	 followed in some cases by playoffs. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants,
	 through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as 
	individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, each against all 
	with one winner.</p>
	<p>Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or
	 physical dexterity, with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting 
	only sports meeting this definition,and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using 
	definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports.However, 
	a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. 
	The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as bona 
	fide sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non
	-physical sports: bridge, chess, draughts (checkers), Go, and xiangqi,and limits the number of mind
	 games which can be admitted as sports.</p>
	<p>Sports are usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition,
	 and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such
	 as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements 
	of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance
	 or artistic impression.</p>
	<p>Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely 
	announced or reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-
	participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider 
	audiences through broadcasting. Sports betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some
	 cases is central to the sport.</p>

<p>
Weightlifting, also called Olympic-style 
weightlifting, or Olympic weightlifting, is 
an athletic discipline in the modern Olympic
 programme in which the athlete attempts a 
maximum-weight single lift of a barbell lo-
aded with weight plates.The two competition
 lifts in order are the snatch and the clean
 and jerk. Each weightlifter receives three 
attempts in each, and the combined total of 
the highest two successful lifts determines 
the overall result within a bodyweight cate-
gory. Bodyweight categories are different for
 male and female competitors. A lifter who 
fails to complete at least one successful 
snatch and one successful clean and jerk also
 fails to total, and therefore receives an 
"incomplete" entry for the competition. The 
clean and press was once a competition lift,
 but was discontinued due to difficulties in 
judging proper form.In comparison with other
 strength sports, which test limit strength 
(with or without lifting aids), Weightlifting
 tests aspects of human ballistic limits 
(explosive strength); the lifts are therefore
 executed faster—and with more mobility and a
 greater range of motion during their execution
—than other strength movements. Properly exec-
uted, the snatch and the clean and jerk are 
both dynamic and explosive while appearing gra-
ceful, especially when viewed from a recording 
at a slowed speed.While there are relatively 
few competitive Olympic weightlifters, the li-
fts performed in the sport of weightlifting, 
and in particular their component lifts (e.g. 
squats, deadlifts, cleans), are commonly used 
by elite athletes in other sports to train for 
both explosive and functional strength.

<center><h1 style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;">Tennis</h1></center>
<p>Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually 
against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of
 two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket 
that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball
covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's
 court. The object of the game is to play the ball in such a 
way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The
 player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point,
 while the opposite player will.Tennis is an Olympic sport and 
is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport 
can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including 
wheelchair users. The modern game of tennis originated 
inBirmingham, England, in the late 19th century as "lawn 
tennis".[1] It had close connections both to various field
 ("lawn") games such as croquet and bowlsas well as to the
 older racket sport of real tennis. During most of the 19th
 century, in fact, the term "tennis" referred to real tennis,
 not lawn tennis: for example, in Disraeli's novel Sybil (1845),
 Lord Eugene De Vere announces that he will "go down to Hampton
 Court and play tennis."[2]The rules of tennis have changed 
little since the 1890s. Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 
1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times,
 and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s. A recent addition
 to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review
 technology coupled with a point challenge system, which allows a
 player to contest the line call of a point, a system known as 
Hawk-Eye.Historians believe that the game's ancient origin lay 
in 12th century northern France, where a ball was struck with the
 palm of the hand.[3] Louis X of France was a keen player of jeu 
de paume ("game of the palm"), which evolved into real tennis, and
 became notable as the first person to construct indoor tennis 
courts in the modern style. Louis was unhappy with playing tennis
 outdoors and accordingly had indoor, enclosed courts made in Paris
 "around the end of the 13th century".[4] In due course this design
 spread across royal palaces all over Europe.[4] In June 1316 at 
Vincennes, Val-de-Marne and following a particularly exhausting game,
 Louis drank a large quantity of cooled wine and subsequently died of 
either pneumonia or pleurisy, although there was also suspicion of 
poisoning.[5] Because of the contemporary accounts of his death, Louis
 X is history's first tennis player known by name.[5] Another of the 
early enthusiasts of the game was KingCharles V of France, who had a 
court set up at the Louvre Palace.[6]It wasn't until the 16th century
 that rackets came into use, and the game began to be called "tennis",
 from the French term tenez, which can be translated as "hold!", "receive!" 
or "take!", an interjection used as a call from the server to his opponent.
[7] It was popular in England and France, although the game was only played 
indoors where the ball could be hit off the wall. Henry VIII of England was
 a big fan of this game, which is now known as real tennis.[8] During the
 18th century and early 19th century, as real tennis declined, new racket
 sports emerged in England.[9]Further, the patenting of the first lawn
 mower in 1830, in Britain, is strongly believed to have been the catalyst,
 world-wide, for the preparation of modern-style grass courts, sporting 
ovals, playing fields, pitches, greens, etc. This in turn led to the
 codification of modern rules for many sports, including lawn tennis,
 most football codes, lawn bowls and others Tennis is played by millions 
of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport. 
The four Grand Slam tournaments (also referred to as the "Majors") are
 especially popular: the Australian Open played on hard courts, the French
 Open played on red clay courts, Wimbledon played on grass courts, and the 
US Open played also on hard courts.

<p>Swimming is an individual or team sport and activity. 
Competitive swimming is one of the most popularOlympic
 sports, with events in butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke,
 freestyle, and individual medley. In addition to these 
individual events, Olympic swimmers also take part in relays.
 Swimmers can also compete in open-water events (e.g., in a
 sea or lake).Leander swimming across the Hellespont. Detail 
from a painting by Bernard Picart.
Evidence of recreational swimming in prehistoric times has 
been found, with the earliest evidence dating to Stone 
Agepaintings from around 10000 years ago. Written references
swimming including the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Bible,Beowulf,
 the Quran and others. In 1538, Nikolaus Wynmann, a German 
professor of languages, wrote the first swimming book,The 
Swimmer or A Dialogue on the Art of Swimming (Der Schwimmer 
oder ein Zweigespräch über die Schwimmkunst).
Swimming emerged as a competitive recreational activity in 
the 1830s in England. In 1828, the first indoor swimming
 pool, St George's Baths was opened to the public.[1] By 
1837, theNational Swimming Society was holding regular 
swimming competitions in six artificial swimming pools,
 built around London. The recreational activity grew in 
popularity and by 1880, when the first national governing
 body, the Amateur Swimming Association, was formed, there
were already over 300 regional clubs in operation across 
the country.[2]The routes taken by Webb and T.W. Burgess 
across the English Channel, in 1875 and 1911, respectively.
In 1844 two Native American participants at a swimming 
competition in London introduced the front crawl to a 
Western audience. Sir John Arthur Trudgen picked up the
 hand-over stroke from some South American natives and 
successfully debuted thenew stroke in 1873, winning a local
 competition in England. His stroke is still regarded as the
 most powerful to use today.[3]Captain Matthew Webb was the 
first man to swim the English Channel (between England and 
France), in 1875. Using the breaststroke technique, he swam 
the channel 21.26 miles (34.21 km) in 21 hours and 45 minutes.

Games played with curved sticks and a ball can be found in
 the histories of many cultures. In Egypt, 4000-year-old c-
arvings feature teams with sticks and a projectile,[5] hur-
ling dates to before 1272 BC in Ireland, and there is a de-
piction from approximately 600 BC in Ancient Greece, where 
the game may have been called keretízein or (?e??t??e??) b-
ecause it was played with a horn or horn-like stick (kéras,
 ???a?).[6] In Inner Mongolia, the Daur people have been pl-
aying beikou, a game similar to modern field hockey, for ab-
out 1,000 years.[7]Most evidence of hockey-like games durin-
g the Middle Ages is found in legislation concerning sports-
 and games. The GalwayStatute enacted in Ireland in 1527 ba-
nned certain types of ball games, including games using "h-
ooked" (written "hockie", similar to "hooky") sticks.[8]

ll balle with hockie stickes or staves, nor use no hande

le[9]By the 19th century, the various forms and divisions
 of historic games began to differentiate and coalesce into
 the individual sports defined today. Organizations dedica-
ted to the codification of rules and regulations began to fo-
rm, and national and international bodies sprang up to manage
 domestic and international competition.Subtypes Bandy game

 on a football field-sized ice arena (bandy rink), typically
 outdoors, and with many rules similar to association footba-
ll. It is played professionally in Russia and Sweden and is 
considered a national sport in Russia. The sport is recognis-
ed by the IOC; its international governing body is the Federa-
tion of International Bandy.Bandy has its roots in England 
in the 19th century, was originally called "hockey on the 
ice",[10] and spread from England to other European countr-
ies around 1900; a similar Russian sport can also be seen as
 a predecessor and in Russia, bandy is sometimes called "Ru-
ssian hockey". Bandy World Championships have been played si-
nce 1957 and Women's Bandy World Championships since 2004. 
There are national club championships in many countries and 
the top clubs in the world play in the Bandy World Cup every
 year.

<p>Football is a family of team sports that invo-
lve,to varying degrees, kicking a ball with the 
foot to score a goal. Unqualified, the word foo-
tball is understood to refer to whichever form 
of football is the most popular in the regional
 context in which the word appears. Sports com-
monly called 'football' in certain places incl-
ude: association football(known as soccer in so-
me countries);  gridiron football(specifically
 American football  or Canadian football);Aust-
ralian rules football; rugby football (either 
rugby leagueor rugby union); and Gaelic football
.[1][2] These different variations  of football
 are known as football codes.Various forms of
 football can be identified in history,  often
 as popular peasant games. Contemporary codes 
 of football can be traced back to the codific-
ation of these games at English public schools
 during the nineteenth century.[3][4] The exp-
anse of the British Empire allowed these rules
 of football to spread to areas of British inf-
luence outside of the directly controlled Emp-
ire.[5] By the end of the nineteenth  century,
 distinct regional codes were already develop-
ing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately
 incorporated the rules of local traditional f-
ootball  games in order to maintain their her-
itage.[6] In 1888, The Football League was fou-
nded in England, becoming  the first of many 
professional football competitions.  During 
the twentieth century, several of the various 
 kinds of football grew to become some of the
 most popular team sports in the world.

<center><h1 style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;">Cricket</h1></center>
<p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two 
teams of eleven players on a cricket field, at the 
centre of which is a rectangular 22-yard-long pitch
 with awicket (a set of three wooden stumps) sited 
at each end. One team, designated the batting team, 
attempts to score as many runs as possible, whilst 
their opponents field. Each phase of play is called 
aninnings. After either ten batsmen have been dism-
issedor a fixed number of overs have been completed,
 the innings ends and the two teams then swap roles.
The winning team is the one that scores the most ru-
ns, including any extras gained, during their one or
 two innings.At the start of each game, two batsmen
 and eleven fielders enter the field of play. The p-
lay begins when a designated member of the fielding 
team, known as thebowler, delivers the ball from one 
that end, in front of which stands one of the batsm-
en,known as the striker. The striker "takes guard"
 on a crease drawn on the pitch four feet in front 
of the wicket. His role is to prevent the ball from
 hitting the stumps by use of hisbat, and simultane-
ously to strike it well enough to score runs. The ot-
her batsman, known as the non-striker, waits at the 
opposite end of the pitch near the bowler. A dismis-
sed batsman must leave the field, and a teammate re-
places him. The bowler's objectives are to prevent 
the scoring of runs and to dismiss the batsman. An 
over is a set of six deliveries bowled by the same 
bowler. The next over is bowled from the other end 
of the pitch by a different bowler.

<center><h1 style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;">Boxing</h1></center>
<p>Boxing is a combat sport in which two people wearingprotective
 gloves throw punches at each other for a predetermined set of 
time in a boxing ring.Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and
 Commonwealth Games sport and is a common fixture in most 
international games—it also has its own World Championships.
 Boxing is supervised by a referee over a series of one- to 
three-minute intervals called rounds. The result is decided when
 an opponent is deemed incapable to continue by a referee, is 
disqualified for breaking a rule, resigns by throwing in a towel,
 or is pronounced the winner or loser based on the judges' 
scorecards at the end of the contest. In the event that both 
fighters gain equal scores from the judges, the fight is considered
 a draw (professional boxing). In Olympic boxing, due to the fact 
that a winner must be declared, in the case of a draw - the judges
 use technical criteria to choose the most deserving winner of the
 bout.While people have fought in hand-to-hand combat since before 
the dawn of history, the origin of boxing as an organized sport may
 be its acceptance by the ancient Greeks as an Olympic game in BC 688.
 Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights, largely in
 Great Britain, to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th 
century, again initially in Great Britain and later in the United States.
The earliest known depiction of boxing comes from a Sumerianrelief 
in Iraq from the 3rd millennium BCE[1] Later depictions from the 
2nd millennium BC are found in reliefs from the Mesopotamiannations
 of Assyria and Babylonia, and in Hittite art from Asia Minor. The
 earliest evidence for fist fighting with any kind of gloves can be 
found on Minoan Crete (c.1650–1400 BCE), and onSardinia, if we 
consider the boxing statues of Prama mountains (c. 2000–1000 BC).[1]
Boxing was a popular spectator sport in Ancient Rome. In order for
 the fighters to protect themselves against their opponents they 
wrapped leather thongs around their fists. Eventually harder leather
 was used and the thong soon became a weapon.[2] The Romans even 
introduced metal studs to the thongs to make the cestuswhich then
 led to a more sinister weapon called the myrmex ('limb piercer').
[citation needed] Fighting events were held at RomanAmphitheatres.
 The Roman form of boxing was often a fight until death to please 
the spectators who gathered at such events. However, especially in
 later times, purchased slaves and trained combat performers were 
valuable commodities, and their lives were not given up without due
 consideration. Often slaves were used against one another in a circle
 marked on the floor. This is where the term ring came from. In AD393,
 during the Roman gladiator period, boxing was abolished due to excessive
 brutality. It was not until the late 17th century that boxing re-surfaced
 in London.[citation needed]Early London prize ring rules[edit]
A straight right demonstrated in Edmund Price's The Science of Defense:
 A Treatise on Sparring and Wrestling, 1867 Records of Classical boxing
 activity disappeared after the fall of the Western Roman Empire when
 the wearing of weapons became common once again and interest in fighting
 with the fists waned. However, there are detailed records of various 
fist-fighting sportsthat were maintained in different cities and provinces
 of Italy between the 12th and 17th centuries. There was also a sport 
inancient Rus called Kulachniy Boy or "Fist Fighting".

<center><h1 style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;">Basketball</h1></center>
<p>Basketball is a sport, generally played by two teams of five players
 on a rectangular court. The objective is to shoot a ballthrough a hoop
 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter and mounted at a height of 10 feet (3.048 m)
 to backboards at each end of the court. The game was invented by Dr. James
 Naismith, who would be the first basketball coach of the Kansas Jayhawks, 
one of the most successful programs in the game's history.A team can score
 a field goal by shooting the ball through the basket being defended by the
 opposition team during regular play. A field goal scores three points for 
the shooting team if the player shoots from behind the three-point line, and 
two points if shot from in front of the line. A team can also score via free
 throws, which are worth one point, after the other team is assessed with 
certain fouls. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but
 additional time (overtime) is issued when the score is tied at the end of 
regulation. The ball can be advanced on the court by throwing it to a teammate,
 or by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling). It is a violation to 
lift, or drag, one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to 
hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.There are many techniques
 for ball-handling—shooting, passing, dribbling, and rebounding. Basketball 
teams generally have player positions, the tallest and strongest members of a
team are called a center or power forward, while slightly shorter and more 
agile players are called small forward, and the shortest players or those who
 possess the best ball handling skills are called a point guard or shooting
 guard. The point guard directs the on court action of the team, implementing
 the coach's game plan, and managing the execution of offensive and defensive 
plays (player positioning).Basketball is one of the world's most popular and
 widely viewed sports.[1] The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most
 popular and widely considered to be the highest level of professional basketball
 in the world and NBA players are the world's best paid sportsmen, by average 
annual salary per player.[2][3] Outside North America, the top clubs from national
 leagues qualify to continental championships such as the Euroleague and FIBA 
Americas League. The FIBA Basketball World Cupattracts the top national teams 
from around the world. Each continent hosts regional competitions for national
 teams, like EuroBasket and FIBA Americas Championship.The FIBA Women's Basketball
 World Cup features the top national women's basketball teams from continental 
championships. The main North American league is the WNBA, whereas the EuroLeague
 Women has been dominated by teams from the Russian Women's Basketball Premier
 League.The circumference of the ball for women is 28 1/2 to 29 inches. The
 basketball in the men's game is between 29 1/2 and 30 inches.In early December
 1891, Canadian Dr. He sought a vigorous indoor game to
 keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New
 England winters. In contrast with modern basketball nets, this 
peach basket retained its bottom, and balls had to be retrieved manually after 
each "basket" or point scored; this proved inefficient, however, so the bottom 
of the basket was removed,[6]allowing the balls to be poked out with a long dowel
 each time. These round balls
 from "association football" were made, at the time, with a set of laces to close
 off the hole needed for inserting the inflatable bladder after the other 
sewn-together segments of the ball's cover had been flipped outside-in.[7][8]
 These laces could cause bounce passes and dribbling to be unpredictable.[9] 
Eventually a lace-free ball construction method was invented, and this change
 to the game was endorsed by Naismith. (Whereas in American football, the lace
 construction proved to be advantageous for gripping and remains to this day.)
 The first balls made specifically for basketball were brown, and it was only 
in the late 1950s that Tony Hinkle, searching for a ball that would be more 
visible to players and spectators alike, introduced the orange ball that is now
 in common use. Dribbling was not part of the original game except for the 
"bounce pass" to teammates.

<p>
Badminton racquet a game being played , which 
two opposing players (singles) or two opposing
 pairs (doubles), a rectangular court divided 
by a net player played face to face with his 
racket shuttlecock killing their opponents' co-
urt to score points in the half. A rally ends 
once the shuttlecock falls to the ground, and 
each side before crossing the shuttlecock can 
only hit once.Shuttlecock (or shuttle) is a fe-
athered projectile whose unique ability to fly
 because of the balls used in most racquet spo-
rts differently is blown. In particular, the 
wings can be drawn much higher, due to the dec-
eleration of the ball is much faster than the 
shuttlecock. Compared to other racquet sports 
shuttlecock is very high top speed. Shuttlecock
 flight is affected by wind, competitive badmi-
nton played indoors so it's good. Sometimes the
 garden or on the beach for fun in the open is
 played badminton.Since 1992, five types of 
events with a badminton Olympic Games are: men's
 and women's singles, men's and women's doubles 
and mixed doubles, in which each pair is a man 
and a woman. At higher levels of the game, the 
game demands excellent fitness: players aerobic
 stamina, agility, strength, speed and precision
 are required. This is a technical sport, the 
good motor coordination and the development of 
sophisticated racquet movements may need.
