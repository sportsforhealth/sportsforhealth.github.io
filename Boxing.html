<p>Boxing is a combat sport in which two people wearingprotective
 gloves throw punches at each other for a predetermined set of 
time in a boxing ring.Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and
 Commonwealth Games sport and is a common fixture in most 
international games—it also has its own World Championships.
 Boxing is supervised by a referee over a series of one- to 
three-minute intervals called rounds. The result is decided when
 an opponent is deemed incapable to continue by a referee, is 
disqualified for breaking a rule, resigns by throwing in a towel,
 or is pronounced the winner or loser based on the judges' 
scorecards at the end of the contest. In the event that both 
fighters gain equal scores from the judges, the fight is considered
 a draw (professional boxing). In Olympic boxing, due to the fact 
that a winner must be declared, in the case of a draw - the judges
 use technical criteria to choose the most deserving winner of the
 bout.While people have fought in hand-to-hand combat since before 
the dawn of history, the origin of boxing as an organized sport may
 be its acceptance by the ancient Greeks as an Olympic game in BC 688.
 Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights, largely in
 Great Britain, to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th 
century, again initially in Great Britain and later in the United States.
The earliest known depiction of boxing comes from a Sumerianrelief 
in Iraq from the 3rd millennium BCE[1] Later depictions from the 
2nd millennium BC are found in reliefs from the Mesopotamiannations
 of Assyria and Babylonia, and in Hittite art from Asia Minor. The
 earliest evidence for fist fighting with any kind of gloves can be 
found on Minoan Crete (c.1650–1400 BCE), and onSardinia, if we 
consider the boxing statues of Prama mountains (c. 2000–1000 BC).[1]
Boxing was a popular spectator sport in Ancient Rome. In order for
 the fighters to protect themselves against their opponents they 
wrapped leather thongs around their fists. Eventually harder leather
 was used and the thong soon became a weapon.[2] The Romans even 
introduced metal studs to the thongs to make the cestuswhich then
 led to a more sinister weapon called the myrmex ('limb piercer').
[citation needed] Fighting events were held at RomanAmphitheatres.
 The Roman form of boxing was often a fight until death to please 
the spectators who gathered at such events. However, especially in
 later times, purchased slaves and trained combat performers were 
valuable commodities, and their lives were not given up without due
 consideration. Often slaves were used against one another in a circle
 marked on the floor. This is where the term ring came from. In AD393,
 during the Roman gladiator period, boxing was abolished due to excessive
 brutality. It was not until the late 17th century that boxing re-surfaced
 in London.[citation needed]Early London prize ring rules[edit]
A straight right demonstrated in Edmund Price's The Science of Defense:
 A Treatise on Sparring and Wrestling, 1867 Records of Classical boxing
 activity disappeared after the fall of the Western Roman Empire when
 the wearing of weapons became common once again and interest in fighting
 with the fists waned. However, there are detailed records of various 
fist-fighting sportsthat were maintained in different cities and provinces
 of Italy between the 12th and 17th centuries. There was also a sport 
inancient Rus called Kulachniy Boy or "Fist Fighting".
