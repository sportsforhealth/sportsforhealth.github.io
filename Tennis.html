<font color="red">
<p>Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually 
against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of
 two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket 
that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball
covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's
 court. The object of the game is to play the ball in such a 
way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The
 player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point,
 while the opposite player will.Tennis is an Olympic sport and 
is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport 
can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including 
wheelchair users. The modern game of tennis originated 
inBirmingham, England, in the late 19th century as "lawn 
tennis".[1] It had close connections both to various field
 ("lawn") games such as croquet and bowlsas well as to the
 older racket sport of real tennis. During most of the 19th
 century, in fact, the term "tennis" referred to real tennis,
 not lawn tennis: for example, in Disraeli's novel Sybil (1845),
 Lord Eugene De Vere announces that he will "go down to Hampton
 Court and play tennis."[2]The rules of tennis have changed 
little since the 1890s. Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 
1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times,
 and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s. A recent addition
 to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review
 technology coupled with a point challenge system, which allows a
 player to contest the line call of a point, a system known as 
Hawk-Eye.Historians believe that the game's ancient origin lay 
in 12th century northern France, where a ball was struck with the
 palm of the hand.[3] Louis X of France was a keen player of jeu 
de paume ("game of the palm"), which evolved into real tennis, and
 became notable as the first person to construct indoor tennis 
courts in the modern style. Louis was unhappy with playing tennis
 outdoors and accordingly had indoor, enclosed courts made in Paris
 "around the end of the 13th century".[4] In due course this design
 spread across royal palaces all over Europe.[4] In June 1316 at 
Vincennes, Val-de-Marne and following a particularly exhausting game,
 Louis drank a large quantity of cooled wine and subsequently died of 
either pneumonia or pleurisy, although there was also suspicion of 
poisoning.[5] Because of the contemporary accounts of his death, Louis
 X is history's first tennis player known by name.[5] Another of the 
early enthusiasts of the game was KingCharles V of France, who had a 
court set up at the Louvre Palace.[6]It wasn't until the 16th century
 that rackets came into use, and the game began to be called "tennis",
 from the French term tenez, which can be translated as "hold!", "receive!" 
or "take!", an interjection used as a call from the server to his opponent.
[7] It was popular in England and France, although the game was only played 
indoors where the ball could be hit off the wall. Henry VIII of England was
 a big fan of this game, which is now known as real tennis.[8] During the
 18th century and early 19th century, as real tennis declined, new racket
 sports emerged in England.[9]Further, the patenting of the first lawn
 mower in 1830, in Britain, is strongly believed to have been the catalyst,
 world-wide, for the preparation of modern-style grass courts, sporting 
ovals, playing fields, pitches, greens, etc. This in turn led to the
 codification of modern rules for many sports, including lawn tennis,
 most football codes, lawn bowls and others Tennis is played by millions 
of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport. 
The four Grand Slam tournaments (also referred to as the "Majors") are
 especially popular: the Australian Open played on hard courts, the French
 Open played on red clay courts, Wimbledon played on grass courts, and the 
US Open played also on hard courts.
