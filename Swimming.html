Evidence of recreational swimming in prehistoric times has 
been found, with the earliest evidence dating to Stone 
Agepaintings from around 10000 years ago. Written references
swimming including the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Bible,Beowulf,
 the Quran and others. In 1538, Nikolaus Wynmann, a German 
professor of languages, wrote the first swimming book,The 
Swimmer or A Dialogue on the Art of Swimming (Der Schwimmer 
oder ein Zweigespräch über die Schwimmkunst).
Swimming emerged as a competitive recreational activity in 
the 1830s in England. In 1828, the first indoor swimming
 pool, St George's Baths was opened to the public.[1] By 
1837, theNational Swimming Society was holding regular 
swimming competitions in six artificial swimming pools,
 built around London. The recreational activity grew in 
popularity and by 1880, when the first national governing
 body, the Amateur Swimming Association, was formed, there
were already over 300 regional clubs in operation across 
the country.[2]The routes taken by Webb and T.W. Burgess 
across the English Channel, in 1875 and 1911, respectively.
In 1844 two Native American participants at a swimming 
competition in London introduced the front crawl to a 
Western audience. Sir John Arthur Trudgen picked up the
 hand-over stroke from some South American natives and 
successfully debuted thenew stroke in 1873, winning a local
 competition in England. His stroke is still regarded as the
 most powerful to use today.[3]Captain Matthew Webb was the 
first man to swim the English Channel (between England and 
France), in 1875. Using the breaststroke technique, he swam 
the channel 21.26 miles (34.21 km) in 21 hours and 45 minutes.
