Games played with curved sticks and a ball can be found in
 the histories of many cultures. In Egypt, 4000-year-old c-
arvings feature teams with sticks and a projectile,[5] hur-
ling dates to before 1272 BC in Ireland, and there is a de-
piction from approximately 600 BC in Ancient Greece, where 
the game may have been called keretízein or (?e??t??e??) b-
ecause it was played with a horn or horn-like stick (kéras,
 ???a?).[6] In Inner Mongolia, the Daur people have been pl-
aying beikou, a game similar to modern field hockey, for ab-
out 1,000 years.[7]Most evidence of hockey-like games durin-
g the Middle Ages is found in legislation concerning sports-
 and games. The GalwayStatute enacted in Ireland in 1527 ba-
nned certain types of ball games, including games using "h-
ooked" (written "hockie", similar to "hooky") sticks.[8]

ll balle with hockie stickes or staves, nor use no hande

le[9]By the 19th century, the various forms and divisions
 of historic games began to differentiate and coalesce into
 the individual sports defined today. Organizations dedica-
ted to the codification of rules and regulations began to fo-
rm, and national and international bodies sprang up to manage
 domestic and international competition.Subtypes Bandy game 
in Sweden.BandyMain article: BandyBandy is played with a ball
 on a football field-sized ice arena (bandy rink), typically
 outdoors, and with many rules similar to association footba-
ll. It is played professionally in Russia and Sweden and is 
considered a national sport in Russia. The sport is recognis-
ed by the IOC; its international governing body is the Federa-
tion of International Bandy.Bandy has its roots in England 
in the 19th century, was originally called "hockey on the 
ice",[10] and spread from England to other European countr-
ies around 1900; a similar Russian sport can also be seen as
 a predecessor and in Russia, bandy is sometimes called "Ru-
ssian hockey". Bandy World Championships have been played si-
nce 1957 and Women's Bandy World Championships since 2004. 
There are national club championships in many countries and 
the top clubs in the world play in the Bandy World Cup every
 year.
