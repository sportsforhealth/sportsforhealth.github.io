<p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two 
teams of eleven players on a cricket field, at the 
centre of which is a rectangular 22-yard-long pitch
 with awicket (a set of three wooden stumps) sited 
at each end. One team, designated the batting team, 
attempts to score as many runs as possible, whilst 
their opponents field. Each phase of play is called 
aninnings. After either ten batsmen have been dism-
issedor a fixed number of overs have been completed,
 the innings ends and the two teams then swap roles.
The winning team is the one that scores the most ru-
ns, including any extras gained, during their one or
 two innings.At the start of each game, two batsmen
 and eleven fielders enter the field of play. The p-
lay begins when a designated member of the fielding 
team, known as thebowler, delivers the ball from one 
that end, in front of which stands one of the batsm-
en,known as the striker. The striker "takes guard"
 on a crease drawn on the pitch four feet in front 
of the wicket. His role is to prevent the ball from
 hitting the stumps by use of hisbat, and simultane-
ously to strike it well enough to score runs. The ot-
her batsman, known as the non-striker, waits at the 
opposite end of the pitch near the bowler. A dismis-
sed batsman must leave the field, and a teammate re-
places him. The bowler's objectives are to prevent 
the scoring of runs and to dismiss the batsman. An 
over is a set of six deliveries bowled by the same 
bowler. The next over is bowled from the other end 
of the pitch by a different bowler.
