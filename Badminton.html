Badminton racquet a game being played , which 
two opposing players (singles) or two opposing
 pairs (doubles), a rectangular court divided 
by a net player played face to face with his 
racket shuttlecock killing their opponents' co-
urt to score points in the half. A rally ends 
once the shuttlecock falls to the ground, and 
each side before crossing the shuttlecock can 
only hit once.Shuttlecock (or shuttle) is a fe-
athered projectile whose unique ability to fly
 because of the balls used in most racquet spo-
rts differently is blown. In particular, the 
wings can be drawn much higher, due to the dec-
eleration of the ball is much faster than the 
shuttlecock. Compared to other racquet sports 
shuttlecock is very high top speed. Shuttlecock
 flight is affected by wind, competitive badmi-
nton played indoors so it's good. Sometimes the
 garden or on the beach for fun in the open is
 played badminton.Since 1992, five types of 
events with a badminton Olympic Games are: men's
 and women's singles, men's and women's doubles 
and mixed doubles, in which each pair is a man 
and a woman. At higher levels of the game, the 
game demands excellent fitness: players aerobic
 stamina, agility, strength, speed and precision
 are required. This is a technical sport, the 
good motor coordination and the development of 
sophisticated racquet movements may need.
