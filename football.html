<font color="red">
<p>Football is a family of team sports that invo-
lve,to varying degrees, kicking a ball with the 
foot to score a goal. Unqualified, the word foo-
tball is understood to refer to whichever form 
of football is the most popular in the regional
 context in which the word appears. Sports com-
monly called 'football' in certain places incl-
ude: association football(known as soccer in so-
me countries);  gridiron football(specifically
 American football  or Canadian football);Aust-
ralian rules football; rugby football (either 
rugby leagueor rugby union); and Gaelic football
.[1][2] These different variations  of football
 are known as football codes.Various forms of
 football can be identified in history,  often
 as popular peasant games. Contemporary codes 
 of football can be traced back to the codific-
ation of these games at English public schools
 during the nineteenth century.[3][4] The exp-
anse of the British Empire allowed these rules
 of football to spread to areas of British inf-
luence outside of the directly controlled Emp-
ire.[5] By the end of the nineteenth  century,
 distinct regional codes were already develop-
ing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately
 incorporated the rules of local traditional f-
ootball  games in order to maintain their her-
itage.[6] In 1888, The Football League was fou-
nded in England, becoming  the first of many 
professional football competitions.  During 
the twentieth century, several of the various 
 kinds of football grew to become some of the
 most popular team sports in the world.
