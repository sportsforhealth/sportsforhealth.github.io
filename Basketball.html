<h1>Basketball</h1>
<font color="blue">
<p>Basketball is a sport, generally played by two teams of five players
 on a rectangular court. The objective is to shoot a ballthrough a hoop
 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter and mounted at a height of 10 feet (3.048 m)
 to backboards at each end of the court. The game was invented by Dr. James
 Naismith, who would be the first basketball coach of the Kansas Jayhawks, 
one of the most successful programs in the game's history.A team can score
 a field goal by shooting the ball through the basket being defended by the
 opposition team during regular play. A field goal scores three points for 
the shooting team if the player shoots from behind the three-point line, and 
two points if shot from in front of the line. A team can also score via free
 throws, which are worth one point, after the other team is assessed with 
certain fouls. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but
 additional time (overtime) is issued when the score is tied at the end of 
regulation. The ball can be advanced on the court by throwing it to a teammate,
 or by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling). It is a violation to 
lift, or drag, one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to 
hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.There are many techniques
 for ball-handling—shooting, passing, dribbling, and rebounding. Basketball 
teams generally have player positions, the tallest and strongest members of a
team are called a center or power forward, while slightly shorter and more 
agile players are called small forward, and the shortest players or those who
 possess the best ball handling skills are called a point guard or shooting
 guard. The point guard directs the on court action of the team, implementing
 the coach's game plan, and managing the execution of offensive and defensive 
plays (player positioning).Basketball is one of the world's most popular and
 widely viewed sports.[1] The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most
 popular and widely considered to be the highest level of professional basketball
 in the world and NBA players are the world's best paid sportsmen, by average 
annual salary per player.[2][3] Outside North America, the top clubs from national
 leagues qualify to continental championships such as the Euroleague and FIBA 
Americas League. The FIBA Basketball World Cupattracts the top national teams 
from around the world. Each continent hosts regional competitions for national
 teams, like EuroBasket and FIBA Americas Championship.The FIBA Women's Basketball
 World Cup features the top national women's basketball teams from continental 
championships. The main North American league is the WNBA, whereas the EuroLeague
 Women has been dominated by teams from the Russian Women's Basketball Premier
 League. In women's basketball the ball used is smaller than that used in men's 
basketball. The circumference of the ball for women is 28 1/2 to 29 inches. The
 basketball in the men's game is between 29 1/2 and 30 inches.In early December
 1891, Canadian Dr. James Naismith,[4] a physical education professor and 
instructor at the International Young Men's Christian Association Training School
[5] (YMCA) (today, Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts was trying
 to keep his gym class active on a rainy day. He sought a vigorous indoor game to
 keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New
 England winters. After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited
 to walled-in gymnasiums, he wrote the basic rules and nailed apeach basket onto a
 10-foot (3.0 m) elevated track. In contrast with modern basketball nets, this 
peach basket retained its bottom, and balls had to be retrieved manually after 
each "basket" or point scored; this proved inefficient, however, so the bottom 
of the basket was removed,[6]allowing the balls to be poked out with a long dowel
 each time.Basketball was originally played with a soccer ball. These round balls
 from "association football" were made, at the time, with a set of laces to close
 off the hole needed for inserting the inflatable bladder after the other 
sewn-together segments of the ball's cover had been flipped outside-in.[7][8]
 These laces could cause bounce passes and dribbling to be unpredictable.[9] 
Eventually a lace-free ball construction method was invented, and this change
 to the game was endorsed by Naismith. (Whereas in American football, the lace
 construction proved to be advantageous for gripping and remains to this day.)
 The first balls made specifically for basketball were brown, and it was only 
in the late 1950s that Tony Hinkle, searching for a ball that would be more 
visible to players and spectators alike, introduced the orange ball that is now
 in common use. Dribbling was not part of the original game except for the 
"bounce pass" to teammates. Passing the ball was the primary means of ball 
movement. Dribbling was eventually introduced but limited by the asymmetric
 shape of early balls. Dribbling only became a major part of the game around
 the 1950s, as manufacturing improved the ball shape.
