<p>Weightlifting, also called Olympic-style 
weightlifting, or Olympic weightlifting, is 
an athletic discipline in the modern Olympic
 programme in which the athlete attempts a 
maximum-weight single lift of a barbell lo-
aded with weight plates.The two competition
 lifts in order are the snatch and the clean
 and jerk. Each weightlifter receives three 
attempts in each, and the combined total of 
the highest two successful lifts determines 
the overall result within a bodyweight cate-
gory. Bodyweight categories are different for
 male and female competitors. A lifter who 
fails to complete at least one successful 
snatch and one successful clean and jerk also
 fails to total, and therefore receives an 
"incomplete" entry for the competition. The 
clean and press was once a competition lift,
 but was discontinued due to difficulties in 
judging proper form.In comparison with other
 strength sports, which test limit strength 
(with or without lifting aids), Weightlifting
 tests aspects of human ballistic limits 
(explosive strength); the lifts are therefore
 executed faster—and with more mobility and a
 greater range of motion during their execution
—than other strength movements. Properly exec-
uted, the snatch and the clean and jerk are 
both dynamic and explosive while appearing gra-
ceful, especially when viewed from a recording 
at a slowed speed.While there are relatively 
few competitive Olympic weightlifters, the li-
fts performed in the sport of weightlifting, 
and in particular their component lifts (e.g. 
squats, deadlifts, cleans), are commonly used 
by elite athletes in other sports to train for 
both explosive and functional strength.
